I'm Dylan, a Hardware Engineer for pay and for fun too! I decided to start this blog as a place for me to share my projects, try to start some interesting discussions and share some things I think are cool.

Stay tuned for...
- Hardware & Firmware Projects
- Experiments in 3D Modelling and Novel Prototyping Techniques
- Tool and Software Reviews
- General Chit-Chat
- Figuring out how to write an engaging blog hidden in the howling expanse of the internet

...and so much more!
